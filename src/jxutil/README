The aim of this project is to create a JSON parser/generator that
has the following features and characteristics:

1.  It should be able to compile on most systems.
2.  It should be nearly standalone, with minimal dependencies,
    e.g. libc.
3.  Handling of incomplete input: the parser should be able to
    persist in an incomplete state, and be resumed once more input
    becomes available.
4.  Support for parsing on a separate thread to allow the main
    thread to continue buffering JSON may reduce the total parsing
    time.
5.  The parser should optionally generate a data-structure or issue
    callbacks, depending on user-preference.
6.  By default the parser/generator should be strict, but support
    for optional JSON type extensions that are cool and/or useful
    should exist, e.g. UTF-8 numeric constants, and Date.
7.  The library should support multiple data-sources, such as
    C-Strings, and UNIX file-descriptors (support for both blocking/
    non-blocking modes). And a low-level set of functions should be
    available to buffer input.
